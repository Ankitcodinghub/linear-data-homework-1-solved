Homework #2

There are three towers and disks of different diameters placed on the first tower. The disks are in order of decreasing diameter as one scans up the tower. Monks were reputedly supposed to move the disk from tower 1 to tower 3 obeying the rules:

Only one disk can be moved at any time.

Homework #4

A (drunken) cockroach is placed on a given square in the middle of a tile floor in a rectangular room of size tiles. The bug wanders (possibly in search of an move from his present tile to any of the eight tiles surrounding him (unless he is against a wall) with equal porbability, how long will it take him to touch every tile on the floor at least once?

An array count is used to represent the number of times our cockroach has reach each tile on the floor. All the cells of this array are initialized to zero. The position of the bug on the floor is represented by the coordinates (ibug, jbug). The eight possible moves of the bug are

represented by the tiles located at , where ,

and

A random walk to any one of the eight neighbor squares is simulated by generating a random value for , lying between and . Of course, the bug cannot move outside the room, so that coordinates that lead up a wall must be ignored, and a square is incremented so that a nonzero entry shows the number of times the bug has landed on that square. When every square has been entered at least once, the experiment is complete.

Write a program to perform the specified simulation experiment. Your program MUST:

(a). handle all values of and ;

(b). perform the experiment for (1) , starting point (10, 10), and (2)

, starting point

For each experiment, print (1) total number of legal moves that the cockroach makes and (2) the final count array. This will show the ‚Äúdensity‚Äù of the walk, that is, the number of times each tile on the floor was touched during the experiment.

This exercise was contributed by Olson.

Input Format

The input consist of multiple lines. Each line have any one the following format.

A line consists of one character ‚Äòa‚Äô and two integer numbers , which , . Represent problem (a).

A line consists of one character ‚Äòb‚Äô and one integer number which is or . Represent problem (b)(1) and (b)(2).

A line consists of one character ‚Äòq‚Äô. (Quit the program.)

Output Format

For each problem:

A line consists of one integer which is the total number of steps; following with lines, each consist of numbers. Each lines represents the row of cells. They are the numbers of visit of that cell.

Sample Input

Sample Output

The output will vary from run to run. We only test the following conditions.

1. All cells walked.

2. The sum of steps match the sum of all number in the cells.
